#<a name="top"></a>NGSIv2 Implementation Notes

This document describes some considerations to take into account
regarding the specific implementation done by Orion Context Broker
of the [NGSIv2 specification](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/).

## Forbidden characters

From "Field syntax restrictions" section at NGSIv2 specification:

> In addition to the above rules, given NGSIv2 server implementations could add additional
> syntactical restrictions in those or other fields, e.g., to avoid cross script injection attacks.

The additional restrictions that apply to Orion are the ones describe in the
[forbidden characters](forbidden_characters.md) section of the manual.

## Custom payload decoding on notifications

Due to forbidden characters restriction, Orion applies an extra decoding step to outgoing
custom notifications. This is described in detail in [this section](forbidden_characters.md#custom-payload-special-treatment)
of the manual.

## Option to disable custom notifications

Orion can be configured to disable custom notifications, using the `-disableCustomNotifications` [CLI parameter](../admin/cli.md).

In this case:

* `httpCustom` is interpreted as `http`, i.e. all sub-fields except `url` are ignored
* No `${...}` macro substitution is performed.

## Limit to attributes for entity location

From "Geospatial properties of entities" section at NGSIv2 specification:

> Client applications are responsible for defining which entity attributes convey geospatial properties
> (by providing an appropriate NGSI attribute type). Typically this is an entity attribute named `location`,
> but nothing prevents use cases where an entity contains more than one geospatial attribute. For instance,
> locations specified at different granularity levels or provided by different location methods with different
> accuracy. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that spatial properties need special indexes which can be under resource
> constraints imposed by backend databases. Thus, implementations may raise errors when spatial index limits are
> exceeded. The recommended HTTP status code for those situations is `413`, *Request entity too large*, and the
> reported error on the response payload must be `NoResourcesAvailable`.

In the case of Orion, that limit is one (1) attribute.

## Legacy attribute format in notifications

Apart from the values described for `attrsFormat` in the NGSIv2 specification, Orion also supports a
`legacy` value, in order to send notifications in NGSIv1 format. This way, users can benefit from the
enhancements of NGSIv2 subscriptions (e.g. filtering) with NGSIv1 legacy notification receivers.

## Disable attribute detail in GET types operation

Not yet implemented, but is expected that Orion will implmement the `noAttrsType` option for the
`GET /v2/types` operation in order to not include attribute details (whose aggregation could be
costly in terms of performance).

## Scope functionality

Orion implements a `scope` field in the `POST /v2/op/update` operation (you can see
[an example in the NGSIv2 walkthrough](walkthrough_apiv2.md#batch-operations)). However, note that this syntax is
somewhat experimental and it hasn't been consolidated in the NGSIv2 specification.

## Error responses

The error response rules defined in https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/issues/1286 takes precedence over
the ones described in "Error Responses" section in the NGSIv2 specification. In particular, Orion Context
Broker never responds with "InvalidModification (422)", using "Unprocessable (422)" instead.

# Subscription payload validations

The particular validations that Orion implements on NGSIv2 subscription payloads are the following ones:

* **description**: optional (max length 1024)
* **subject**: mandatory
    * **entities**: mandatory
        * **id** or **idPattern**: one of them is mandatory (but both at the same time is not allowed). id
            must follow NGSIv2 restrictions for IDs. idPattern must be not empty and a valid regex.
        * **type**: optional (but if present it must follow NGSIv2 restrictions for IDs)
    * **condition**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
        * **attrs**: optional (but if present it must be a list; empty list is allowed)
        * **expression**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
            * **q**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **georel**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **geometry**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
            * **coords**: optional (but if present it must be not empty, i.e. `""` is not allowed)
* **notification**:
    * **http**: must be present if `httpCustom` is omitted, forbidden otherwise
        * **url**: mandatory (must be a valid URL)
    * **httpCustom**: must be present if `http` is omitted, forbidden otherwise
        * **url**: mandatory (must be not empty)
        * **headers**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
        * **qs**: optional (but if present it must have a content, i.e. `{}` is not allowed)
        * **method**: optional (but if present it must be a valid HTTP method)
        * **payload**: optional (empty string is allowed)
    * **attrs**: optional (but if present it must be a list; empty list is allowed)
    * **metadata**: optional (but if present it must be a list; empty list is allowed)
    * **exceptAttrs**: optional (but it cannot be present if `attrs` is also used; if present it must be a non-empty list)
    * **attrsFormat**: optional (but if present it must be a valid attrs format keyword)
* **throttling**: optional (must be an integer)
* **expires**: optional (must be a date or empty string "")
* **status**: optional (must be a valid status keyword)


# actionType metadata

From NGSIv2 specification section "Special metadata in notifications", regarding `actionType` metadata:

> Its value depend on the request operation type: `update` for updates,
> `append` for creation and `delete` for deletion. Its type is always `Text`.

Current Orion implementation supports "update" and "append". The "delete" case will be
supported upon completion of [this issue](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/issues/1494).
